Simple Redis-based generic views for serving your Django-backed Ember CLI apps.

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is at https://django-redis-views.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* Serves your single page javascript apps easily through Django views.
* Works out-of-the-box with `ember-cli-deploy
  <https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy>`_ and 
  `ember-deploy-redis <https://github.com/LevelbossMike/ember-deploy-redis>`_.

Background
----------

Ember CLI and other single-page javascript apps can be challenging to deploy.

Luke Melia presented a talk called 
`Lightning Fast Deployment of Your Rails-backed JavaScript app <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZVYP3cPcWQ>`_,
which eventually led to the creation of `ember-cli-deploy <https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy>`_.

This project acts as the glue between `ember-cli-deploy` and Django by
providing generic views to serve `Redis <http://redis.io/>`_-backed index pages for single
page javascript applications.


Quickstart
----------

Let's assume we already have an Ember CLI app that we're ready to deploy.
We're using the `ember-deploy-redis
<https://github.com/LevelbossMike/ember-deploy-redis>`_ adapter and we 
ran `ember deploy` to push the `index.html` file into Redis.
In this case, we'll pretend that the
Ember CLI project's name is `ember-cli-my-great-app`.

First, install django-redis-views::

    pip install django-redis-views

In your Django settings file, set the Redis url. For example, you may want
to access Redis on the localhost running on the default port. In which case,
you would add something like this to the your `settings.py` file::

    REDIS_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

Then, to use it in your Django project, first add a new view to a
`views.py` file::

    from redis_views import RedisView


    class EmberAppIndex(RedisView):
        app_name = 'ember-cli-my-great-app'

And then set it a route for it in your `urls.py` file::

    from django.conf.urls import url
    from myapp.views import EmberAppIndex


    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^$', EmberAppIndex.as_view()),
    ]
    
At this point, you should be able to go to your root url and see your index
page!

Injecting Context to your Template
----------------------------------

If you want to use Django's template engine to replace values in your Ember
index file, you can do that by injecting the context. Let's pretend that we
have this very simple Ember index page:

    <p>Hello {{ name }}!</p>

In order to inject `{{ name }}` from Django into the Ember index page,
you'll want to add to the context. This package is built upon the generic views
in Django, so we inject context the same way that they do. In your `views.py`
file (using the same conventions as above)::

    from redis_views import RedisView

    class EmberAppIndex(RedisView):

        . . . 

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            # Call the base implementation first to get a context
            context = super(EmberAppIndex, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
            # Add in the name value (you could also use a dynamic value from a database object)
            context['name'] = 'Joe'
            return context

Then, in the template, it will fill in the value with your supplied value.
As mentioned in the comment, you can inject pretty much anything that could
normally be handled by Django templates, such as a CSRF token.

Running the Tests
-----------------

To run the tests, please do the following in your terminal::

    # Install the testing requirements
    pip install -r requirements-test.txt

    # Run the tests
    py.test
